## Conclusion

"In sports betting an accuracy of 55% and over is considered good as it indicates profits.". 

Therefore, the models built have a good scores. Classification models accuracy are as following:

| Algorithm          | Accuracy | F1-score | Jaccard  | LogLoss |
| ------------------ | -------- | -------- | -------- | ------- |
| KNN                | 0.628571 | 0.628571 | 0.458333 | NA      |
| Decision Tree      | 0.657143 | 0.657143 | 0.489362 | NA      |
| SVM                | 0.571429 | 0.571429 | 0.400000 | NA      |
| LogisticRegression | 0.685714 | 0.685714 | 0.521739 | 1.03719 |
