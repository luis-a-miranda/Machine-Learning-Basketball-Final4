## Conclusion

In sports betting, an accuracy of 55% or above is considered very good as it indicates profits on conservative betting strategies. Therefore, the models built have a good scores. Classification models accuracy are as following:

| Algorithm           | Accuracy | F1-score | Jaccard  | LogLoss |
| ------------------  | -------- | -------- | -------- | ------- |
| KNN                 | 0.628571 | 0.628571 | 0.458333 | NA      |
| Decision Tree       | 0.657143 | 0.657143 | 0.489362 | NA      |
| SVM                 | 0.571429 | 0.571429 | 0.400000 | NA      |
| Logistic Regression | 0.685714 | 0.685714 | 0.521739 | 1.03719 |
